# Project365

This repo is a coding project for myself.
Starting on 1st January 2018, I will attempt to program each solution listed below for each day of the year.
Obviously most solutions will need a couple of days to figure out. However the main goal is to make sure that a solution is uploaded each day throughout the entire year.
New solutions will be added throughout the year.

Project ideas were obtained from [Karan Project Solutions](https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions), [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks) and [martyr2s mega project idea list](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/).

- [ ] Happy numbers
	- A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.
- [ ] Number names

## Games
- [ ] Battleship
	- Create two game boards and let each player place a number of war ships. Each player can’t see the other person’s board. They then take turns firing at one another by guessing one of the board squares. If the square they guess contains part of a ship, it is a hit. Otherwise it is a miss. They sink a ship when all squares containing that particular ship have been uncovered. The player wins when all their opponent's ships have been sunk.
- [ ] Chess and Checkers
	- Simply put a game of chess or checkers. Try to make it playable online and if you can use a graphical user interface that can also undo or redo a step as well as keep a history of moves for replay.
- [ ] Hangman
	- Randomly select a word from a file, have the user guess characters in the word. For each character they guess that is not in the word, have it draw another part of a man hanging in a noose. If the picture is completed before they guess all the characters, they lose.
- [ ] Frogger

- [ ] Higher or Lower Guessing game
	- Create a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 and the user has to guess what the number is. After every guess, the computer should tell the user if the guess is higher or lower than the answer. When the user guesses the correct number, print out a congratulatory message.
- [ ] Magic 8 Ball
	- I'm sure you've used a magic 8 ball at one point in your life. You ask it a question, turn it right side up and it gives an answer by way of a floating die with responses written on it. You can create one in python.
	
## Security
- [ ] Ceasar Cipher
	- Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "mono-alphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.

- [ ] Count and Fix Green Eggs and Ham	
	- "Some of you may remember the Dr. Sues story ""Green Eggs and Ham"". For those of you that don't remember it or have never heard of it, here is the story. However, there is a problem with the story I gave you - every time the word I is used, it is lowercase. Because of this problem, your job is to do the following... 1.Copy the story I gave you into a regular text file. 2.Create a program that reads through the story and makes the letter i uppercase any time it should be. (Make sure to change it when it's used in sam-I-am's name too.) 3.Have your program make a new file, and have it write out the story correctly. 4.Print out how many errors were corrected."		https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects/comments/1i6sax/challenge_count_and_fix_green_eggs_and_ham/	http://imgur.com/GRkj3yz
- [ ] Turn Based Pokemon Style Game	
	- "Write a simple game that allows the user and the computer to take turns selecting moves to use against each other. Both the computer and the player should start out at the same amount of health (such as 100), and should be able to choose between the three moves: 1) The first move should do moderate damage and has a small range (such as 18-25). 2) The second move should have a large range of damage and can deal high or low damage (such as 10-35). 3) The third move should heal whoever casts it a moderate amount, similar to the first move. After each move, a message should be printed out that tells the user what just happened, and how much health the user and computer have. Once the user or the computer's health reaches 0, the game should end. SUBGOALS 1) When someone is defeated, make sure the game prints out that their health has reached 0, and not a negative number. 2) When the computer's health reaches a set amount (such as 35%), increase it's chance to cast heal. 3) Give each move a name."		https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects/comments/1aw0iq/project_turn_based_pokemon_style_game/	
- [ ] Bulk Renamer and Organizer	
	- This program will take a series of files and renames them with a specific filename filter entered by the user. For instance if the user enters myimage###.jpg it will rename all files with a “minimum” of three numbers like “myimage001.jpg”, “myimage145.jpg” or even “myimage1987.jpg” since 1987 has at least three numbers.
